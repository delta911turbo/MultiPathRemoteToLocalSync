WinSCP - MultiPath Remote To Local Sync Powershell Script

Modified version of KeepLocalUpToDate.WinSCPextension.ps1 script which is provided in the extension folder of WinSCP 5.9.2+. Instead of having to use the file mask option to include/exclude subfolders based off a root folder, this script allows for input of both multiple remote and local folders that individually synchronized.
